# Interview Tests

## Overview

At Capco, transparency and fairness are core values that we want to be reflected in our hiring process.

We have opened source the interview tests we ask our Associate and Consultant candidates to develop at home.

The assessment should take a couple of days to be completed, however we aim to be flexible as possible and we do understand candidates may have a limited amount of time to work on the application.   

## Our expectations

Inside each test we have underlined what the candidate will be examinated on. Depending on the level and the development language chosen, we expect the successful candidate to adopt different techniques and technical implementations.

Moreover, other than code quality and standards adopted, we also examine each candidate individually, valuing experience, potential and ability to reason.

## Instructions

Please select the level (Associate or Consultant) you are applying for and choose a preferred language to complete the assessment with.
